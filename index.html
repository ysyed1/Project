    <p> Welcome to my site! I hope to share popular everyday recipes from my South Asian household with you all, combining my 
        love for cooking and Indian culture. Posted are recipes for each category: beverage, appetizer, main dish, 
        and dessert!</p>
        
    <p> I hope to expose others to the flavors of the South Asian cuisine. While these delicacies may be enjoyed at Indian restaurants, they
        can also be made at home with only a few ingredients! For example, turmeric (referred to as haldi in Urdu) is an Indian spice used
        in countless South Asian recipes and beauty routines; however, Americans are only familiar with the spice in turmeric lattes at 
        coffee shops. In this time of social distancing, my site could help others develop a new hobby & a love for Indian spices & flavors.</p>
